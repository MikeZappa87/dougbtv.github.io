Hey hey hey, it's Doug.

I'm from [Burlington, VT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont) (Our airport code is *BTV*, hence *dougbtv*). 

## Links & Projects

Here's some out of date links. Because, well.... I always forget to look at this about page!

Some links to projects I'm involved with and/or interested in:

* I'm a member of [Laboratory B](http://www.laboratoryb.org/), Burlington's gritty hackerspace. 
* I've written a programming language for Ethereum contacts called [Sectivum](http://sectivum.io/)
* [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) and cryptocurrency in general is a big interest of mine.

This entire blog is written in markdown, and is [available as a github repo](https://github.com/dougbtv/dougbtv.github.io), if you want to get some content out of it in a different way than say, just loading up this web page.


## Tech

I used to keep a list of tech I'm interested in here, but.... Everything changes faster than I'm able to update this markdown, so.... I removed it :)
