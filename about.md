Hey hey hey, it's Doug.

I'm from [Burlington, VT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont) (Our airport code is *BTV*, hence *dougbtv*). 

I love to slang code, especially in the [MEAN stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN), with a lot of experience in the LAMP stack. I'm all about open source software, and GNU/Linux. I'm a developer at heart, but, I love Linux systems, databases, and devops. I also work a lot on telephony, and custom Asterisk apps at work. Oh yeah, I like mobile dev to an extent too. 

## Links & Projects

Some links to projects I'm involved with and/or interested in:

* I'm a member of [Laboratory B](http://www.laboratoryb.org/), Burlington's gritty hackerspace. 
* I've written a programming language for Ethereum contacts called [Sectivum](http://sectivum.io/)
* [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) and cryptocurrency in general is a big interest of mine.

This entire blog is written in markdown, and is [available as a github repo](https://github.com/dougbtv/dougbtv.github.io), if you want to get some content out of it in a different way than say, just loading up this web page.
