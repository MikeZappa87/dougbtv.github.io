The first files go onto tape storage on tapeDuino! [The Silence Dogood letters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silence_Dogood) are a kind of friendly hoax that Benjamin Franklin played on his brother when he was a kid. They're pretty funny -- if you have the patience to really read them, they won't make a prime-time TV spot these days. Kind of highlighting this is a device for patience readers. It was the kind of collection that's right in about the size-range that's nice for a little series. And slightly more fun than the other historical documents I've been storing on it.

One thing that's kinda nice about the text is that with bz2 it compresses like crazy, so you feel like you're storing a lot, ummm... Relative to this device :)

So far in this photo, that first tape is full, with letters 1-9 (there's 14 in the series). The tape is a single, I should add. Or at least, it's only 10 minutes / side. If you want to read all of the [Silence Dogood letters, you can find them from the library](http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedNames.jsp) at Yale university.
