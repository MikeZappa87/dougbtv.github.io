tapeDuino, 80s-ified. Complete with a faux wood panel, decals, status LEDs, LCD read-out, and... Bad cassette tapes. I got the inspiration for the Atari font, faux wood & black plastic from seeing [the gAtari](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8e7g8kJIlo)Â [youtube].

It's in good working order, which is nice. Hopefully it's ready for some show-time to demonstrate \m/
