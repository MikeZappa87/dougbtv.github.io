With one of these [Rock's BBQ Stoker](https://www.rocksbarbque.com/index.html), a wifi unit to stoke & baffle your BBQ smoker; I could be making ribs for dinner from my desk at work. Dammmmn.

Yeah, it's a kinda robotic smoker. Not exactly quite as [cool as the Bum Bot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjBXFn4-TSo), which is genius. But, the stoker is probably a bit more ethical.
