Many thanks to my buddy who helped me build this frame/rack! Err, really he did the building. He's a brain behind [woodgivesmewood.com](http://woodgivesmewood.com/) (worth a look, more than once). It's looking awesome, umm, ahem, _spee-roing_! which it would not've had I gone at it with a handsaw and a dremel, which is what I would've done if he wasn't so kind as to rock his skills and his bad-ass woodshop in the honor of this device.

Here's an idea I've been mulling over. In the most simple terms this is a kind of "abacus for programmers". I call it heroOfArduinia. It's based on a concept invented (or improved upon) by [Hero of Alexandria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria). An inventor from around 10AD. He's best known for his [pneumatic wonders, especially his aeolipile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile) (an _almost_-steam-engine-before-the industrial-revolution).

What I'm most fond of Hero for is, well... Number one is the fact that this guy made inventions which were used as a sort of magic in order to fool temple-goers into thinking the temple they were in was the most divine, or somehow, had the power of the gods. In reality: it was just bad-ass technology for it's day. Secondly, he invented a device which was used for sequencing. Personally, I think it's the world's first cybernetic device.

Yep, like that. So this is a kind of study of that device, however... Mine is going to be used a kinda turing abacus. For now, I'll leave it at that, as I've got too much to say about it.
