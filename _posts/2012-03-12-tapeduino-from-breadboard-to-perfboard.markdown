![photocrati gallery](http://dougbtv.com/wp-content/themes/photocrati-theme/photocrati-gallery/image/gallery-placeholder-1.gif)tapeDuino's birth into this world was rather rough, in all sorts of distorted breadboard reality, but... I'm relatively happy with how the perfboard turned out. You'll notice the DB-9 subminiature receptacle on there at this stage. That's for the interface to the sony tape deck -- mostly for style points. Counter-intuitively, but, naturally... The actual data goes over the audio interface, through the 3.5mm socket.
